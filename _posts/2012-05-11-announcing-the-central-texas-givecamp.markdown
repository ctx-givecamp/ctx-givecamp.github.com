We're happy to announce that we're planning the inaugural Central Texas GiveCamp to be held on September 15th in Austin, TX! A GiveCamp is an event that runs over the course of one weekend, bringing developers, designers and a variety of technologists together to donate a portion of their time to helping non-profit organizations with their technology needs. If you are a software developer, designer, database administrator or anything remotely close, sign up to stay informed about CTX GiveCamp.

Give Camp is not only a great place to give back to the community, but also a fun time to spend with fellow professionals, students, or hobbyists. GiveCamps have been hosted worldwide, with thousands of volunteers helping hundreds of charities. Come be part of this great experience.

Whether you are looking to use your skills as a volunteer, charity, or even as a sponsor of the event, add your email address to the form above and we'll be in touch as news about the event is announced.
