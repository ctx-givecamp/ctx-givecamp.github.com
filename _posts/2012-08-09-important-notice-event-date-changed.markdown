title: Important Notice&#58; EVENT DATE CHANGED
---

As some of you may have noticed, we've changed the date for Central Texas Give Camp **to September 28th &mdash; 30th**.

The success of each project is of the upmost importance to us, and extra time for planning will ensure that teams and charities are properly prepared to get to work right away when the event starts. 

As an added bonus, we are scheduling a Meet and Greet for all team members and non-profit representatives **on Friday, September 14th from 6:00-9:00 PM** at the Headspring office.  This time is set aside for teams to meet their project leaders, get a briefing on the project plan, and organize ideas for execution. Light refreshments will be provided. 

We are in the process of emailing all confirmed projects and team members about the change. If you have questions or concerns, please contact [info@ctxgivecamp.org](mailto:info@ctxgivecamp.org).

On a final note, we're still recruiting weekend participants and sponsors. Anyone looking to get share their time or resources with a deserving non-profit, please consider signing up. You won't regret it!
