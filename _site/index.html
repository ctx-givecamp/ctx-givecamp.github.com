      <h3>The GiveCamp Meet-and-Greet <small>17 Sep 2012</small></h3>
      <p>The Central Texas GiveCamp kicked off on Friday night with a meet-and-greet for the charities and the volunteers who have signed up to help. The night began with an introduction to the different non-profits that have been selected to receive tech-help for the GiveCamp weekend. The charities spoke a little about their mission and the help that they need from the Central Texas community. After getting to know them and their needs, the volunteers selected which projects they would most like to work with.</p>

</p>
<p>Every project got fully staffed and the teams discussed their preliminary approaches with the non-profits. After a short meeting (and a couple bottles of beer for a few teams), the team-building exercise began. The challenge: to create the tallest structure possible using popsicle sticks, paper plates, and masking tape. It was a lot harder than it sounds, though, and the tallest creation was made very creatively by taping popsicle sticks to the ceiling. After it was over, our host revealed that the reason it was so challenging was because some teams had way too many popsicle sticks and not enough tape, while other teams had too much tape and only a couple of popsicle sticks. The moral was even though there may be different teams for the GiveCamp, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask around for particular skills from other teams. Everyone is ultimately on the same team and the only real goal is to help as many charities as possible.</p>
